# Feature Sequence Diagram: Recipe Addition with IndexedDB

**Feature Description:**
This feature initializes an IndexedDB database (`recipesDB`) and allows users to add new recipes. When a recipe is successfully added, an event is emitted to update other parts of the app, such as the UI, with the new recipe data. This sequence illustrates the initialization of the database, addition of a recipe, and notification of the successful operation.
