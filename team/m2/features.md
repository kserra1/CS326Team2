**Personal Recipe Storage**
This will function as a history for past created recipes, similar implementation as search history for web browsers.
Users can click on an icon that brings them to a list of past recipes, and click on these recipes with a further description.
This feature is important as many users will want to make recipes that they've created before and thus need a refresher
on what ingredients and directions are needed.

**Community Recipe Sharing**
This will act like a social media app where users will see recipes from other users in a feed. Users can scroll through this
feed, where they can like and comment on recipes. When they like a recipe, it is added to a "Liked" tab that can be used for
future use if they want to try the recipe themselves. This adds some interconnectivity to the application, as it allows for growth
through people sharing their ideas, the guiding principle to how social media became so popular in the first place. It also allows
helps users who are looking to expand and try new recipes, or struggling to find new ideas of what to cook.

**Search Feature**
This feature will provide a way for people who may know specifically what recipe they are looking to find to get the exact
ingredients and steps to cooking the recipe. Recipes can be searched based on ingredients, meal type, user, or cuisine. This
feature will benefit users who already have a recipe, or person in mind that they want to access.
