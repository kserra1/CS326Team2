# Problem Statement
## Problem Description


Many individuals love discovering, creating, and sharing recipes but struggle to organize them in a meaningful and accessible way. With a variety of recipes across multiple meal types--breakfast, lunch, dinner, and desserts--managing personal favorites and discovering new ones can become overwhelming. Existing platforms for sharing recipes often lack personalized organization tools, and community interaction around food tends to be scattered across general social media platforms.


##Proposed Solution
Our web application, **InstaFood**, will offer a platform for storing, organizing, and sharing recipes. InstaFood will allow users to categorize their personal recipes under distinct sections, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. Each user can easily upload their own recipes, and view recipes shared by other users. Users can also comment on others recipes, allowing for community feedback. InstaFood will also offer a search feature, allowing users to search for recipes based on ingredients, meal type, or user.


Key features include:

**Personal Recipe Storage**: Users can upload their own recipes and categorize them under breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert.

**Community Recipe Sharing**: Users can view and comment on recipes shared by other users.

**Search Feature**: Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, meal type, or user.

Offering a streamlined, community-focused recipe management application, InstaFood will provide a platform for food lovers to discover, create, and share recipes in a new and exciting way

##Why This Matters

In today's world, many people are looking for community based recipes in a single concise platform. People don't want to search for recipes on multiple platforms with no simple way to also create their own. InstaFood not only simplifies the process of managing personal recipes but also creates a sense of community by connecting users with others who share a passion for food. This platform encourages creativity in the kitchen and makes it easier for people to explore diverse recipes and meal ideas.
